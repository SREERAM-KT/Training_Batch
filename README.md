## Definitions:

Oops:
   - object
   - class
   - inheritance
   - polymorphism
   - encapsulation
   - abstraction

Inheritance: Acquiring properties of base/parent class by sub/child class

Constructor: Initialising values to the object.It's name is same as class name and does not have return type

Polymorphism: A function or operator doing different tasks.There are 2 types - Compile time(Overloading) & run time(Overiding)

Overloading: It is a compile time polymorphism and happens within a class.Same method with different signatures will perform polymorphism

Overriding: It is a run time polymorphism and happens between base and sub classes.Same method with different signatures will perform polymorphism within parent & child classes

Data Abstraction: The process of hiding implementation details and showing only background details

Abstract Class: Abstract Class should have atleast 1 abstract method

Interface: Interface should have only abstract methods

Abstract Method: The method with no function implementation/body.

Object: Real world entity with properties and behaviours

Class: Blueprint for object

Data Encapsulation: Binding data with functions using objects

Access specifiers: specifies the accessibilty of a class/method/data within the program
   - Public: accessible to all classes
   - Private: accessible within the class
   - Protected: accessible within the class and child class
